# WhatsUp
A system status monitoring tool (and a React.Js learning laboratory)

This is yet another technology playground, although my goal is to make this into a usable and usefull tool for a
current customer of ours. Not like there wasn't a tool like this around already, but the point is to learn new stuff.

The stack is:
  - ReactJs front-end
  - Node.js back-end
  - MongoDB used through the Mongoose library
  - Socket.IO for the real-time features
